We want to continue a legacy of craftsmen making tools that propel humanity forward.

## Collaborating with Thinking Machines

Our vision is to develop thinking machines that work alongside humans.

We envision a future where AI is safely used as a tool in our daily lives, like fire and electricity. These robots enhance human potential and do not replace our key decision-making. You own your own AI.

## Solarpunk, not Dune

Our vision is rooted in an optimistic view of AI's role in humanity's future.

Like the [Solarpunk movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk), we envision a world where technology and nature coexist harmoniously, supporting a sustainable and flourishing ecosystem.

We focus on AI's positive impacts on our world. From environmental conservation to the democratization of energy, AI has the potential to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our planet.
