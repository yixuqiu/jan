## Troubleshooting NVIDIA GPU
To resolve issues when Jan does not utilize the NVIDIA GPU on Windows and Linux systems.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Verify Hardware and System Requirements

#### 1.1. Check GPU Detection
First, verify that your system recognizes the NVIDIA GPU:
**Windows:**
- Right-click desktop → NVIDIA Control Panel
- Or check Device Manager → Display Adapters
**Linux:**
```
lspci | grep -i nvidia
```
#### 1.2. Install Required components
**NVIDIA Driver:**
1. Install [NVIDIA Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/) for your GPU (NVIDIA driver **470.63.01 or higher**).
2. Verify installation:

```
nvidia-smi
```
Expected output should show your GPU model and driver version.

**CUDA Toolkit:**
1. Download and install [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (**CUDA 11.7 or higher**)
2. Verify installation:

```
nvcc --version
```
**Linux Additional Requirements:**
1. Required packages are installed:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-11 g++-11 cpp-11
```
See [detailed instructions](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17).

2. Set up CUDA environment:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
```
See [detailed instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions).

<Callout type="info">
Ensure your (V)RAM is accessible; some users with virtual RAM may require additional configuration.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Turn on GPU acceleration

Jan manages GPU usage automatically:
- Switches to GPU mode when supported
- Automatically selects GPU with highest VRAM

To verify GPU acceleration is turned on:
1. Open **Settings** > **Hardware**
2. Verify that **GPU Acceleration** is turned on
3. Verify your selected GPU(s) are visible in **System Monitor** from Jan's footer

<br/>
![Hardware](./_assets/trouble-shooting-01.png)
<br/>


### Step 3: GPU Settings Check

1. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > Open **Jan Data Folder**
2. Open **Settings** folder
3. Open `settings.json` file

Example `settings.json`:

```
{
  "notify": true,
  "run_mode": "gpu",
  "nvidia_driver": {
    "exist": true,
    "version": "531.18"
  },
  "cuda": {
    "exist": true,
    "version": "12"
  },
  "gpus": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "vram": "12282"
    },
    {
      "id": "1",
      "vram": "6144"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "vram": "6144"
    }
  ],
  "gpu_highest_vram": "0"
}
```
**Key Configuration Values:**
- `run_mode`: Should be "gpu" for GPU acceleration
- `nvidia_driver`: Shows driver status and version
- `cuda`: Shows CUDA toolkit status and version
- `gpus`: Lists available GPUs and their VRAM (in MB)
- `gpu_highest_vram`: ID of GPU with most VRAM



### Step 4: Restart Jan

## Permission Denied

When running Jan, you might encounter the following error message:

```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Error invoking layout-480796bff433a3a3.js:538 remote method 'installExtension':
Error Package /Applications/Jan.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/pre-install/janhq-assistant-extension-1.0.0.tgz does not contain a valid manifest:
Error EACCES: permission denied, mkdtemp '/Users/username/.npm/_cacache/tmp/ueCMn4'
```

Permission problems mainly cause this error during installation. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open your **Terminal**

2. Execute the following command to change ownership of the `~/.npm` directory to the current user:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```

This command ensures that the necessary permissions are granted for Jan's installation.


## "Failed to fetch" or "Something's Amiss" errors

When you start a chat with a model and encounter a **Failed to Fetch** or **Something's Amiss** error, here are some possible solutions to resolve it:

**1. Check System & Hardware Requirements**
- Hardware dependencies: Ensure your device meets all [hardware requirements](docs/troubleshooting#step-1-verify-hardware-and-system-requirements)
- OS: Ensure your operating system meets the minimum requirements ([Mac](/docs/desktop/mac#minimum-requirements), [Windows](/docs/desktop/windows#compatibility), [Linux](docs/desktop/linux#compatibility))
- RAM: Choose models that use less than 80% of your available RAM
  - For 8GB systems: Use models under 6GB
  - For 16GB systems: Use models under 13GB

**2. Check Model Parameters**
- In **Engine Settings** in right sidebar, check your `ngl` ([number of GPU layers](/docs/models/model-parameters#engine-parameters)) setting to see if it's too high
- Start with a lower NGL value and increase gradually based on your GPU memory

**3. Port Conflicts**

If you check your [app logs](/docs/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs) & see "Bind address failed at 127.0.0.1:39291", check port availability:
```
# Mac
netstat -an | grep 39291

# Windows
netstat -ano | find "39291" 
tasklist /fi "PID eq 39291"

# Linux
netstat -anpe | grep "39291"
```
<Callout type="info">
  `Netstat` displays the contents of various network-related data structures for active connections.
</Callout>

Default Jan ports:
- Jan and Cortex API Server: `1337`
- Jan Documentation: `3001`

**4. Factory Reset**

A factory reset can resolve persistent issues by returning Jan to its original state. This will remove all custom settings, downloaded models, and chat history.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**
2. At **Reset To Factory Settings**, click **Reset**

<Callout type="warning">
