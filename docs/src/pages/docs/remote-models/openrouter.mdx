# OpenRouter

## Integrate OpenRouter with Jan

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a tool that gathers AI models. Developers can utilize its API to engage with diverse large language models, generative image models, and generative 3D object models with a competitive pricing.

Jan supports OpenRouter API integration, allowing you to use models from various providers (Anthropic, Google, Meta and more) through a single API.

**Model Field Settings:**
- Leave empty to use your account's default model
- Specify a model using the format: `organization/model-name`
- Available options can be found in [OpenRouter's Model Reference](https://openrouter.ai/models)

**Examples of Model IDs:**
- Claude 3 Opus: `anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229`
- Google Gemini Pro: `google/gemini-pro`
- Mistral Large: `mistralai/mistral-large`

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have sufficient credits in your OpenRouter account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify OpenRouter's [system status](https://status.openrouter.ai)
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm the model is currently available on OpenRouter
- Check if you're using the correct model ID format
- Verify the model provider is currently operational
