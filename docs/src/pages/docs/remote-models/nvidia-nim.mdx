## Available Nvidia NIM Models

Jan automatically includes NVIDIA NIM's available models. In case you want to use a specific model that you cannot find in **Jan**, follow instructions in [Manual Setup](/docs/models/manage-models#4-manual-setup) to add custom models:
  - See list of available models in [Nvidia NIM Documentation](https://build.nvidia.com/models).
  - The `id` property must match the model name in the list.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have billing set up on your NVIDIA account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify NVIDIA's system status
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your NVIDIA account has the necessary permissions
- Make sure you're using Jan version 0.5.1 or later
