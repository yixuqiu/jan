# Privacy

Jan is an app that allows you to own your AI. We prioritize your control over your data and explain what data we collect and why. 

- Jan can't see your chats with AI
- You're free to opt out

## Why and what we track

To build a reliable, user-friendly AI that you own, we need to understand how Jan is used. We collect two types of data: performance data and usage data.

### Performance data
We track app crashes and collect technical details about what went wrong, along with basic information about the hardware you’re using.

When Jan crashes, we collect technical details about what went wrong.

- Specific AI model in use during the crash
- Hardware: `CPU`, `GPU`, `RAM`
- Logs: `Date/Time`, `OS & version`, `app version`, `error codes & messages`.

### Usage data

We track data like how often the app is opened to check:

- **Active Users**: How many people use Jan daily to measure engagement
- **Retention Rates**: To understand if users are finding value in Jan over time

Usage data is tied to a randomly generated telemetry ID. None of our usage data can be linked to your personal identity.

## What we **don’t** track:
- Your conversations with Jan. Those stay on your device.
- Your files. We don’t scan, upload, or even look at them.
- Anything tied to your identity.

## Using Cloud Models

Jan allows you to connect cloud model APIs. If you choose to use cloud-based models (e.g. GPT, Claude models), the API provider handling the model will have access to your messages as part of processing the request. Again, Jan doesn't see or store these messages - they go directly to the provider. Remember: With local models, everything stays on your device, so no one - not even us- can see your messages.

## Where we store & process data
We use [PostHog](https://posthog.com/eu) EU for analytics, ensuring all data is processed within the European Union. This setup complies with GDPR and other strict privacy regulations. PostHog lets us self-host and securely manage the data we collect. Read more [on PostHog's GDPR doc](https://posthog.com/docs/privacy/gdpr-compliance).
