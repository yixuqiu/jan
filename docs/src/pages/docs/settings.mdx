2. Changes apply immediately for all new messages you type

<br/>
![Spell Check](./_assets/settings-06.png)
<br/>

## Keyboard Shortcuts
At **Settings** (<Settings width={16} height={16} style={{display:"inline"}}/>) > **Keyboard shortcuts**, you can see Jan's shortcuts list:

**1. Thread Management**
- `⌘ N` - Create a new thread
- `⌘ Shift Backspace` - Delete current active thread
- `⌘ Shift C` - Clean current active thread

> Note: On **Windows** and **Linux**, use `Ctrl` (Control) instead of `⌘` (Command)

## Hardware
At **Settings** (<Settings width={16} height={16} style={{display:"inline"}}/>) > **Hardware**, you can monitor and manage your system resources when running local models.

### CPU & RAM

<Callout type="info">
See detailed minimum system requirements to run local models on [Mac](/docs/desktop/mac#compatibility), [Windows](/docs/desktop/windows#compatibility) & [Linux](/docs/desktop/linux#compatibility).
</Callout>

- **CPU:** important for model processing speed. With CPU only, 20-90% usage during model running is normal.

- **RAM:**
  - Different models require different amounts of RAM.
  - When running local models, please keep at least **4GB free**.
  - If usage is near max, try closing other applications or use smaller models.


### GPU Acceleration

<Callout type="info">
Ensure you have installed all required dependencies and drivers before enabling GPU acceleration. See **GPU Setup Guide** on [Windows](/docs/desktop/windows#gpu-acceleration) & [Linux](/docs/desktop/linux#gpu-acceleration) for detailed instructions.
</Callout>

Turn on GPU acceleration to improve performance:
1. Select and **enable** your prefered GPU(s)
2. App reload is required after the selection

<br/>
![Hardware](./_assets/trouble-shooting-01.png)
<br/>

**GPU Performance Optimization**
- Monitor VRAM usage - should not exceed 90%. Higher **VRAM** capacity typically enables better performance for larger language models.
- Adjust `ngl` ([number of GPU Layers](/docs/models/model-parameters#engine-parameters)) in **Model** settings:
  - Higher NGL = more VRAM used with faster performance
  - Lower NGL = Less VRAM used with slower performance
  - Start with 35 layers for 8GB VRAM. Increase if you have more VRAM available & decrease if you see **out-of-memory** errors.



## Privacy 
At **Settings** (<Settings width={16} height={16} style={{display:"inline"}}/>) > **Privacy**, you can control analytics & logs in Jan:

### Analytics
Jan is built with privacy at its core. By default, no data is collected. Everything stays local on your device.
You can help improve Jan by sharing anonymous usage data:
1. Toggle on **Analytics** to share anonymous data
2. You can change this setting at any time

<Callout type="info">
Read more about that we collect with opt-in users at [Privacy](/docs/privacy). 
</Callout>

<br/>

<br/>
![Edit Jan Data Folder](./_assets/settings-12.png)
<br/>

### HTTPs Proxy 
HTTPS Proxy encrypts data between your browser and the internet, making it hard for outsiders to intercept or read. It also helps you maintain your privacy and security while bypassing regional restrictions on the internet.

<Callout type="info">
- Model download speeds may be affected due to the encryption/decryption process and your cloud service provider's networking
- HTTPS Proxy does not affect the remote model usage.
</Callout>

1. **Enable** the proxy toggle
2. Enter your proxy server details in the following format:
```
http://<user>:<password>@<domain or IP>:<port>
```
Where:
- `<user>`: Your proxy username (if authentication is required)
- `<password>`: Your proxy password (if authentication is required)
- `<domain or IP>`: Your proxy server's domain name or IP address
- `<port>`: The port number for the proxy server

<br/>
![HTTPs Proxy](./_assets/settings-13.png)
<br/>

**Ignore SSL Certificates**

This setting allows Jan to accept self-signed or unverified SSL certificates. This may be necessary when:
- Working with corporate proxies using internal certificates
- Testing in development environments
- Connecting through specialized network security setups

<Callout type="info">
Only enable this option if you trust your network environment.
</Callout>

<br/>
![Ignore SSL Certificates](./_assets/settings-14.png)
