## Core Extensions 

### Cortex
The primary extension that manages both **local** and **remote engines** capabilities:

#### Local Engines
[llama.cpp](/docs/local-engines/llama-cpp): Fast, efficient local inference engine that runs GGUF models directly on your device. Powers Jan's default local AI capabilities with support for multiple hardware configurations.

#### Remote Engines
- [Anthropic](/docs/remote-models/anthropic): Access Claude models
- [Cohere](/docs/remote-models/cohere): Access Cohere's models
- [Groq](/docs/remote-models/groq): High-performance inference
- [Martian](/docs/remote-models/martian): Specialized model access
- [MistralAI](/docs/remote-models/mistralai): Access Mistral models
- [NVIDIA NIM](/docs/remote-models/nvidia-nim) (NVIDIA Inference Microservices): Platform for deploying and serving GPU-accelerated AI models, providing enterprise-grade reliability and scalability.
- [OpenAI](/docs/remote-models/openai): Access GPT models
- [OpenRouter](/docs/remote-models/openrouter): Multi-provider model access
- [Triton-TRT-LLM](/docs/remote-models/triton): High-performance inference backend using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server with TensorRT-LLM optimization, designed for large-scale model deployment.
